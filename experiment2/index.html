			<h1>Experiment 2 - The Useless Canvas</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
				</div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Tried to make a digital equivalent of the Useless Box.</p>
				<p>Our circle friend's name is Redy. He prefers a clean canvas</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Redy uses loadPixel() to scan the canvas for drawn lines</p>
				<p>loadPixel creates an array that he can use to path towards</p>
				<p>Redy then just deposits a white circle where he was, and then</p>
				<p>scoots himself a little closer toward the black pixel.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The project initially seemed simple enough, but it became more difficult as</p>
				<p>I added more and more functionality to Redy. Another issue that came up</p>
				<p>was I couldn't get it to work on my laptop, Redy kind of became a moron</p>
				<p>and no matter what I tried, I couldn't get him to work. I thought it was</p>
				<p>because of the processor power, but it turns out load pixel has issues</p>
				<p>if the canvas isn't completely on the screen, and that is probably why</p>
				<p>fixing the pathing logic didn't fix it at all. Unfortunately, it's too</p>
				<p>late to fix that error. So it paths with loadpixel still</p>
